As we [announced back in February](/blog/2017/02/now-in-beta-effective-testing-with-rspec-3/),
Ian Dees and I have written a new book for the Pragmatic Bookshelf
about RSpec, entitled _Effective Testing with RSpec 3: Build Ruby Apps with Confidence_.
We're happy to announce that the book is out of beta and is now shipping from
[pragprog.com](https://pragprog.com/book/rspec3/effective-testing-with-rspec-3) and from
[amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Testing-RSpec-Build-Confidence/dp/1680501984/).

We put a ton of work over the last three years into this book, distilling our
combined 20 years of testing experience into a book that explains how to do
TDD/BDD well using RSpec. We believe that anyone who wants to learn RSpec or
that regularly uses RSpec will benefit from the book.

If you want to learn more about the book, check out this video Ian put together about it:
