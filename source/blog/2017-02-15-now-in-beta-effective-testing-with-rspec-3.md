title: "Now in Beta: Effective Testing with RSpec 3"
author: Myron Marston

Six years ago, [The RSpec Book](https://pragprog.com/book/achbd/the-rspec-book)
introduced thousands of people to RSpec and helped them get the most out of the
framework. Since that time, RSpec has continued to evolve. RSpec 3 brought many
changes to help developers build and test better Ruby programs. The RSpec Book,
released over 6 years ago, does not cover these changes.  Readers have been
asking: _is there going to be a new book?_

In fact, [Ian Dees](https://twitter.com/undees) and I have been hard at work on
a brand new book for over two years. Ian brings with him a wealth of experience
from using RSpec since 2006. He has a keen ability to translate technical
concepts into easy-to-read, enjoyable books, such as the PragProg titles [Seven
More Languages in Seven
Weeks](https://pragprog.com/book/7lang/seven-more-languages-in-seven-weeks) and
[Cucumber Recipes](https://pragprog.com/book/dhwcr/cucumber-recipes).

I've been the lead maintainer of RSpec since 2012.  I've built many of RSpec's
notable additions in recent years, including composable matchers, the `--bisect`
and `--only-failures` options, and the `:aggregate_failures` features. Together,
we've written a book we're very proud of, and we're happy to announce it is now in beta:

We've written [Effective Testing with RSpec 3: Build Ruby Apps with
Confidence](https://pragprog.com/book/rspec3/effective-testing-with-rspec-3) to
be _the_ definitive guide to modern RSpec. If you're new to RSpec, it's a
perfect introduction. If you've used RSpec before, but haven't kept up with the
recent changes, this book will get you up to speed.

Our book goes far beyond the RSpec documentation, walking through
building a real-world JSON API and then diving deep into each part
of RSpec. The theme of _effective testing_--using practices to get
more _value_ out of your specs than the cost of writing them--is woven
throughout.
