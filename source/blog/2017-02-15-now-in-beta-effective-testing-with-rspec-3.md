title: "Now in Beta: Effective Testing with RSpec 3"
author: Myron Marston
---

Years ago, [The RSpec Book](https://pragprog.com/book/achbd/the-rspec-book)
introduced many people to RSpec and helped them get the most out of the
framework. Since that time, RSpec has continued to evolve, with the release
of RSpec 3 bringing many changes. The RSpec Book, released over 6 years ago,
is now quite out of date, and many users have been asking: is there going
to be a new book?

In fact, [Ian Dees](https://twitter.com/undees) and I have been hard
at work on a brand new book for over two years. Ian brings with him
a wealth of experience from using RSpec since 2006, and a keen ability
to translate technical concepts into easy-to-read, enjoyable books,
as previously seen in PragProg titles like [Seven More Languages in Seven
Weeks](https://pragprog.com/book/7lang/seven-more-languages-in-seven-weeks)
and [Cucumber Recipes](https://pragprog.com/book/dhwcr/cucumber-recipes).
I've been the lead maintainer of RSpec since 2012, and have built many of
notable features that RSpec has gained in recent years. Together, we've
written a book we're very proud of, and we're happy to announce it is
now in beta:

We've written [Effective Testing with RSpec 3: Build Ruby Apps with
Confidence](https://pragprog.com/book/rspec3/effective-testing-with-rspec-3)
to be _the_ definitive guide to modern RSpec. If you've never used RSpec
before, it's a perfect introduction. If you've used RSpec, but haven't kept
up with the recent changes, this book will get you up to speed with the
latest and greatest features.

This book goes far beyond the RSpec documentation, walking through
building a real-world JSON API and then diving deep into each part
of RSpec. The theme of _effective testing_--using practices to get
more _value_ out of your specs than the cost of writing them--is woven
throughout.

If you're interested in the book, you can purchase the beta eBook now!
